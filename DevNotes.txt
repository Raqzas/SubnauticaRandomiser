Thoughts and notes on features and issues.
  
- Randomise more things.
  - Fish spawn points.
  - Fish size and aggression.
  - Raw material spawn points.
    
- Add a casual mode.
  - Casual mode would respect vanilla upgrade chains and be more lenient with its
    randomisation. Perhaps calculate depth with more searchTime? Guarantee all
    vehicles can be made at vanilla depths?
    
- Add a fiendish mode.
  - Many more recipes are locked behind databoxes scattered throughout the ocean.
  - Databoxes can be many more places, including the cave systems in many biomes.
  - Raw materials are no longer found in their original biomes.
    
- Add support for glitches.
  - Several glitches in the game can let you get items or blueprints much earlier.
  - It is possible to glitch into the aurora before it even explodes.
    - Since this would make the logic run on a timer, better not implement this.
  - Large wrecks can be made to despawn with the building tool, skipping the need
    for e.g. a laser cutter.
  - Table coral can be acquired with a Crashfish, or bumping into it with a vehicle.
    No knife required!
  
- Scrap metal!
  - For some reason, the existing logic works on some recipes but not for others.
    It makes no sense.
  - Randomising anew after the crafting tree has already been built once (i.e.,
    a fabricator has been interacted with) makes it impossible to change until
    next game restart. The scrap metal recipe could thus persist across seeds.

Aurora Notes:
- Fragments do spawn in LivingArea and CargoRoom, but not very often. Require very
  high rates to do anything.
- Upgrade spawns are set in the editor and hard to get a hold of without modifying
  every dropped upgrade in the game.



Thoughts from a playthrough:
- Ensure access to food and water using one of the following:
  - Indoor growbed (covers both)
  - Alien Containment (covers both)
  - Water filter (covers water, get food from surrounding fish)
- What about land seeds? If those get added, indoor growbeds are a necessity.

Other:
- Sea treaders are a potential anti softlock mechanism. You could change their
  poop and shale into something useful on the fly, or make shale always contain
  something useful in the first place.
