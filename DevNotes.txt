How blueprints and the new system in general should work:

- Read information from the CSV
  - For items which have that information, create a Blueprint object and build
    the Recipe object with that included.
  - Blueprints can unlock in one of three ways: collect an item, craft an item,
    or via fragment scan. A given blueprint may also unlock a chain of others.
    - For example, Blood Oil unlocks Benzene AND Aramid Fibers, although the
      latter do not include Blood Oil in their recipe.
  - Many of the fields defining blueprint unlock information will have a fragment
    listed there. 
- In the future,the CSV will likely be able to drop the following categories:
  - Ingredients. These are used as a fallback crutch by the previous system, and
    a true logic-based system should have no need of them.
    
- Expand on fragments and databoxes.
  - Somehow collect a ton of data on them. Where do they spawn, how many, are they
    looked behind wreckage doors, what tools do you need to access them, etc.
  - From this information, make it possible to randomise the amount of fragments
    needed for each blueprint.
  - Is it possible to swap fragments around?
  - What about databoxes? Can you swap those?
  
- Clean up saving / loading.
  - It is not necessary to save blueprints and categories to disk. If that info
    is needed again, it is re-read from disk anyways. Cut down on file size.
- Seeding.
  - This perhaps ties into the point above, but as of right now seeds are so
    stupidly long they're nigh on unusable. Figure out a way to implement short,
    easily shareable seeds. Bonus points if they do not rely on settings to be 
    the very same.
    
   
   
Additional Thoughts:
- If fish are enabled, ensuring that the player has access to an aquarium by a
  certain depth level would be really nice. Same goes for eggs.
