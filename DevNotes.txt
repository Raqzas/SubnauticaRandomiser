Thoughts and notes on features and issues.

- In the future,the CSV will likely be able to drop the following categories:
  - Ingredients. These are used as a fallback crutch by the previous system, and
    a true logic-based system should have no need of them.
    
- Expand on fragments.
  - Make it possible to randomise the amount of fragments
    needed for each blueprint.
  - Is it possible to swap fragments around?
  
- Clean up saving / loading.
  - It is not necessary to save blueprints and categories to disk. If that info
    is needed again, it is re-read from disk anyways. Cut down on file size.
  - Make this change when something else requires a change to masterDict anyway.
  - Fragments are a pretty good bet.
  - Also include save versioning as a field of masterDict.
    
- Add a casual mode.
  - Casual mode would respect vanilla upgrade chains and be more lenient with its
    randomisation. Perhaps calculate depth with more searchTime? Guarantee all
    vehicles can be made at vanilla depths?
    
- Add a fiendish mode.
  - Many more recipes are locked behind databoxes scattered throughout the ocean.
  - Databoxes can be many more places, including the cave systems in many biomes.
  - Raw materials are no longer found in their original biomes. Look into using
    LootDistributionHandler for this?
    
   
  
Thoughts from a playthrough:
- Ensure access to food and water using one of the following:
  - Indoor growbed (covers both)
  - Alien Containment (covers both)
  - Water filter (covers water, get food from surrounding fish)
- What about land seeds? If those get added, indoor growbeds are a necessity.
- Add Aurora interior to logic. What parts need repair tool, laser cutter, cannon?
- Scrap metal!
