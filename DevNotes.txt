How blueprints and the new system in general should work:

- Read information from the CSV
  - For items which have that information, create a Blueprint object and build
    the Recipe object with that included.
  - Blueprints can unlock in one of three ways: collect an item, craft an item,
    or via fragment scan. A given blueprint may also unlock a chain of others.
    - For example, Blood Oil unlocks Benzene AND Aramid Fibers, although the
      latter do not include Blood Oil in their recipe.
  - Many of the fields defining blueprint unlock information will have a fragment
    listed there. 
      
- In the future,the CSV will likely be able to drop the following categories:
  - Ingredients. These are used as a fallback crutch by the current system, and
    a true logic-based system should have no need of them.
  - Prerequisites. Their usefulness is limited in a true randomiser. However,
    there might still be a use case in a less random, more casual setting of the
    randomiser, where upgrades are still treated as sequential.
    - Also, they work well for base pieces. Having a nuclear reactor won't do
      you much good if you cannot make any multipurpose rooms.
  - CraftAmount. A companion field to Ingredients and similarly not much more
    than a crutch for the simple randomiser. However, it could be retooled into
    a Price or Value field which assigns each item a basic value related to
    how difficult or annoying it is to get. Titanium would get a much lower value
    than Lithium, for example. Even non-raw items would gain such a value, calculated
    from their vanilla ingredients, which then provides the randomiser with a
    rough idea of what to shoot for with the new ingredients it is selecting.
    - As a side effect, such a system would also reduce grinding. Getting ten
      pieces of Titanium is a very different beast to getting ten Diamonds. The
      difficulty of the randomiser should lie in figuring out how to get *TO* an
      ingredient, not how to find twenty of them.
    
- Build a dependency/progression tree which assigns each of the major milestones
  several solutions with which to reach them.
  - This tree does not have to be absolute. For example, while a cyclops only
    lets you reach 500m, exploring with a rebreather and seaglide can easily let
    you go down another one or two hundred - which could make all the difference
    particularly where fish or seeds are concerned.
