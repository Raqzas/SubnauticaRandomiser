﻿Thoughts and notes on features and issues.
  
- Randomise more things.
  - Fish spawn points.
  - Fish size and aggression.
  - Raw material spawn points.
  
- Expand on fragments.
  - Make it possible to randomise the amount of fragments
    needed for each blueprint.
  - Is it possible to swap fragments around?
  - Change what resources you get upon scanning duplicate fragments
    - Maybe you'd get one or two resources needed to build what you scanned?
  - Add fragments to prerequisites for regular items.
    
- Add a casual mode.
  - Casual mode would respect vanilla upgrade chains and be more lenient with its
    randomisation. Perhaps calculate depth with more searchTime? Guarantee all
    vehicles can be made at vanilla depths?
    
- Add a fiendish mode.
  - Many more recipes are locked behind databoxes scattered throughout the ocean.
  - Databoxes can be many more places, including the cave systems in many biomes.
  - Raw materials are no longer found in their original biomes. Look into using
    LootDistributionHandler for this?
    
- Add support for glitches.
  - Several glitches in the game can let you get items or blueprints much earlier.
  - It is possible to glitch into the aurora before it even explodes.
    - Since this would make the logic run on a timer, better not implement this.
  - Large wrecks can be made to despawn with the building tool, skipping the need
    for e.g. a laser cutter.
    
- Mod support.
  - Even if autodetecting mods and their items seems impossible with how the
    randomiser works right now, giving users the ability to do it themselves
    should be a priority.
  - Perhaps expose the progression tree? This would allow for more customisation,
    and enable modded items to act as gateways and road blocks.
    
- Internal improvements.
  - Make reading the CSV an async function.
  
- Scrap metal!
  - For some reason, the existing logic works on some recipes but not for others.
    It makes no sense.
  - Randomising anew after the crafting tree has already been built once (i.e.,
    a fabricator has been interacted with) makes it impossible to change until
    next game restart. The scrap metal recipe could thus persist across seeds.
  - Savedata idea which does not lead to a breaking update:
    - Scrap metal is never crafted. Therefore, it does not have a recipe. Because
      of this, it also does not have an entry in masterDict.
    - Abuse this and file the new recipe for whatever scrap metal can be turned
      *into* under scrap metal.

   
  
Thoughts from a playthrough:
- Ensure access to food and water using one of the following:
  - Indoor growbed (covers both)
  - Alien Containment (covers both)
  - Water filter (covers water, get food from surrounding fish)
- What about land seeds? If those get added, indoor growbeds are a necessity.
- Add Aurora interior to logic. What parts need repair tool, laser cutter, cannon?


Thoughts from users:
- Add console commands to reroll a specific recipe only.

Other:
- Sea treaders are a potential anti softlock mechanism. You could change their
  poop and shale into something useful on the fly, or make shale always contain
  something useful in the first place.
