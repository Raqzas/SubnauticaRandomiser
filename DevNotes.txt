Thoughts and notes on features and issues.
  
- Randomise more things.
  - Fragments.
  - Fish spawn points.
  - Fish size and aggression.
  - Raw material spawn points.
  
- Expand on fragments.
  - Make it possible to randomise the amount of fragments
    needed for each blueprint.
  - Is it possible to swap fragments around?
    
- Add a casual mode.
  - Casual mode would respect vanilla upgrade chains and be more lenient with its
    randomisation. Perhaps calculate depth with more searchTime? Guarantee all
    vehicles can be made at vanilla depths?
    
- Add a fiendish mode.
  - Many more recipes are locked behind databoxes scattered throughout the ocean.
  - Databoxes can be many more places, including the cave systems in many biomes.
  - Raw materials are no longer found in their original biomes. Look into using
    LootDistributionHandler for this?
    
- Add a spoiler log.
  - What path does the randomiser expect you to take? What are the major milestones?
  - Where are all the databoxes?
  - Include basic info on settings and seed so that sharing the log also turns into
    an easy way to debug user issues.
    
   
  
Thoughts from a playthrough:
- Ensure access to food and water using one of the following:
  - Indoor growbed (covers both)
  - Alien Containment (covers both)
  - Water filter (covers water, get food from surrounding fish)
- What about land seeds? If those get added, indoor growbeds are a necessity.
- Add Aurora interior to logic. What parts need repair tool, laser cutter, cannon?
- Scrap metal!

Thoughts from users:
- Add console commands to reroll a specific recipe only.
- Document the CSV.
